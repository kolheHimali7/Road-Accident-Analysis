This project involves developing an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze road accident data. The analysis includes key metrics such as accident frequency, severity, time of occurrence, and locations. Visualizations highlight trends over time, accident-prone areas, and contributing factors like weather conditions, vehicle types, and driver behavior. The dashboard provides actionable insights for stakeholders, enabling data-driven decisions to improve road safety and reduce accident rates.
